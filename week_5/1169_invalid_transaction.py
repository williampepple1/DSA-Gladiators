if it occurs within (and including) 60 minutes of another transaction with the same name in a different city.
You are given an array of strings transaction where transactions[i] consists of comma-separated values representing the name, time (in minutes), amount, and city of the transaction.

Output: ["alice,20,800,mtv","alice,50,100,beijing"]
